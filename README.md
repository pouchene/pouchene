🇬🇧 (🇫🇷 coming soon)

===================================

👋 Hi there, welcome to my GitHub.

===================================

📊 I currently work in statistical data analysis, and show great interest in time series modelling and computer programming.

💻 I code mainly using Python, R and Matlab, and currently learn C and C++ for both data analysis and personal projects.

👀 Onlookers are welcome to stick around but will not find anything interesting here for now.

🇪🇺 Feel free to check my [CV - Europass](https://europa.eu/europass/eportfolio/api/eprofile/shared-profile/f613fd51-cfb6-4bd3-9775-67bc7351830e?view=html)

🌱 I am uploading from time to time the material I use and produce while studying.

📫 I invite you to contact me through [GitHub](https://github.com/pouchene) or [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/pierre-ouchene)

🍻 Cheers!
