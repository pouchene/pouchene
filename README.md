Pierre @pouchene Ouchene's repository.

- 📊 I currently work in statistical data analysis, and show great interest in time series modelling and computer programming.

- 💻 I code mainly using Python, R and Matlab, and currently learn C and C++ for both data analysis and personal projects.

- 👀 Onlookers are welcome to stick around but will not find anything interesting here for now.

- 🌱 I am uploading from time to time the material I use and produce while studying.
